This is a first draft for using the ZachTek WSPR-TX Xp transmitter without a GPS antenna. 
It connects to a Timeserver via NTP.
Initial Network setup is via a Captive web portal.
As of now, there are no way to reset the WiFi setting other than refprogramming.  
But there is the resetWiFi() function, that can be used for this. 
A future amendment to the main code can facilitate this, via a new software command or a button press.
Stay tuned :)
